I intend to make a series of these for each of the major libraries that I have studied. Any field that requires an input will always be named as \"finp\" (function input) so as not to be confused for any other parameter or prenamed field. finp will be accompanied by any '' or .txt extensions to make it clear that finp is purely the given name of the file and everything else is required syntax for proper usage of that function"
